# gds-react

## Objective

Develop a comprehensive React library that aligns with the principles, guidelines, and components provided by the [GDS Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/), ensuring consistency, accessibility, and ease of use for building interactive user interfaces.

## Key Goals

### Alignment with [GDS Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)

Ensure that all components, styles, and behaviors adhere closely to the specifications outlined in the [GDS Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/), fostering consistency and familiarity across government digital services.

### Accessibility Compliance

Implement accessibility features following the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and GDS accessibility guidelines, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can access and interact with the components effectively.

### Usability and User Experience

Design components with a focus on usability, intuitiveness, and efficiency, providing a seamless experience for end-users interacting with government digital services.

### Modularity and Reusability

Develop components in a modular and reusable manner, enabling developers to easily integrate them into different projects and applications, reducing redundancy and promoting code maintainability.

### Documentation and Support

Provide comprehensive documentation, including usage guidelines, API references, and examples, to assist developers in effectively utilizing the library. Offer ongoing support and updates to address issues and maintain compatibility with evolving requirements.

### Integration with GOV.UK Frontend

Integrate seamlessly with the govuk-frontend library to leverage its CSS, fonts, images, and JavaScript, ensuring consistency with the wider [GDS Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) ecosystem and facilitating adoption by developers familiar with [GDS Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) standards.

## What’s next

As we proceed further, you’ll be learning how:

- the base structure of the library is created?
- to reuse or update the styling of this library as per govuk-frontend library?
- to import this library to use it in the other applications?
- the components are created and what basic feature each one of them supports?
- to enhance the functionality of any existing component of this library?
- to add any new component with it’s basic features into this library?
- the releases and versions are maintained?
